You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

# Examples
# [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] -->  11 (the only odd number)

# [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] --> 160 (the only even number)



From this problem, I can say that I really improved my algorithm thinking. At first, I was looking too deep into it, but later I found a simple way to solve it.

What I did: I used a for loop to go through the list, worked with lists and indexes, and practiced the append method. I also learned to check even and odd numbers in a clean way using %.

In short, I tried to keep the code simple and easy to read. This task helped me to make my logic stronger and think more clearly while solving problems.
