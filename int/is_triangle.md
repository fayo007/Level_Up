# Description:
# Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

# (In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

# Examples:

# Input -> Output
# 1,2,2 -> true
# 4,2,3 -> true
# 2,2,2 -> true
# 1,2,3 -> false
# -5,1,3 -> false
# 0,2,3 -> false
# 1,2,9 -> false 


This task helped me understand how conditions work and also I learned the special rule for a triangle to be valid.
In this problem, I had to write code that checks many conditions at the same time, and it was a bit confusing at the beginning, but after some thinking, I got the idea.

The main point here is to know that a triangle is only valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
I didn't know this before clearly, so this was helpful for me.

Also I feel like solving this will help me in future projects and also improve my algorithmic thinking step by step.
