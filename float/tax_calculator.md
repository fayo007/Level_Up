# Write a function to calculate compound tax using the following table:
# For $10 and under, the tax rate should be 10%.
# For $20 and under, the tax rate on the first $10 is %10, and the tax on the rest is 7%.
# For $30 and under, the tax rate on the first $10 is still %10, the rate for the next $10 is still 7%, and everything else is 5%.
# Tack on an additional 3% for the portion of the total above $30.
# Return 0 for invalid input(anything that's not a positive real number).
# Examples:
# An input of 10, should return 1 (1 is 10% of 10)
# An input of 21, should return 1.75 (10% of 10 + 7% of 10 + 5% of 1)
# * Note that the returned value should be rounded to the nearest penny.


I can say that this problem really helped me improve my skills in working with conditions. It was actually fun to deal with multiple condition checks in this task. I also practiced using the isinstance function, and I learned that you can pass multiple types inside it using a tuple.
I also got more comfortable with using the or operator inside condition statements.
Besides that, I practiced the round function and now I feel more confident using it in the future.
Overall, this challenge helped me a lot to strengthen my understanding of float values and working with them in Python.
